This app is an entirely personal project and is not officially endorsed by any company or organization. It is not a replacement for sound judgment or common sense. While every reasonable effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the calculations contained herein, no warranty—expressed or implied—is made as to the app’s reliability, correctness, fitness for a particular purpose, or ability to successfully predict your professional destiny.</p>

  <p>By employing the results provided by this app, you acknowledge and agree that I bear no responsibility for any errors, oversights, incorrect inputs, or eyebrow-raising outcomes, including (but not limited to) failing to meet your collection goals, underestimating costs, or annoying your boss.</p>

  <p>This app is subject to ongoing improvement (or spontaneous breakdown) at my sole discretion, and I reserve the right to update, alter, or accidentally break it without prior notice. If you encounter issues, let me know, but remember: you get what you pay for. (Hint: It's free.)</p>

  <h2>Credit Calculator</h2>
  <p>The Credit Calculator estimates how many daily cards you need to hit your AOR and percentage goals. It takes your Past Due percentage and subtracts today’s Target Close Goal percentage, then calculates the Card Difference like this:</p>
  <p><strong>Cards Needed = ((Past Due % - Close Goal %) × AOR) ÷ 100.</strong></p>
  <p>For the Open Goal, your Now Due percentage is compared to tomorrow’s Target Open Goal percentage using the same formula. If more than 10% of your AOR is rolling, the app informs you how many cards are needed to reach that goal.</p>

  <h2>Cost Calculator</h2>
  <p>The Cost Calculator finds your total weekly cost and breaks it down into bi-weekly and monthly equivalents. First, the weekly price adds a required LDW (Liability Damage Waiver):</p>
  <p><strong>Weekly Price = Base Price × 1.1</strong></p>
  <p>Then applies sales tax like this:</p>
  <p><strong>Total Weekly Price = Weekly Price × 1.06 (PA Sales Tax)</strong></p>
  <p>If you toggle the BP (Club) fee, it adds $3.17 to the final weekly price <strong>AFTER</strong> all other calculations. The bi-weekly cost doubles the weekly total, and the monthly cost multiplies the weekly price by 4.345.</p>
